abstract: Heterogeneity occurs in many regression problems, where members from different latent subgroups respond differently to the covariates of interest (e.g., treatments) even after adjusting for other covariates. Our work adopts a Bayesian model called the mixture of finite mixtures (MFM) to identify these subgroups. A key feature of this model is that the number of subgroups needs not to be known a priori, and is modeled as a random variable. The Bayesian MFM model was not commonly used in earlier applications largely due to computational difficulties. In comparison, an alternative infinite mixture model called the Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) model has been a main Bayesian tool for clustering even though it is a mis-specified model for many applications. The popularity of DPM is partly due to its convenient mathematical properties that enable efficient computing algorithms.	We propose a class of conditional MFMs (cMFM) that are tailored to regression problems, and solve the computing problem by extending the MCMC scheme for general MFMs in Miller and Harrison (2018). Using simulation and real data examples, we demonstrate the advantages of our cMFM, notably more reasonable clustering results, compared to that of existing frequentist methods, the DPM, and the original MFM models in various setups.
