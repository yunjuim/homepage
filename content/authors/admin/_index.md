I am a postdoctoral associate working with Dr. Shuangge Ma in the Department of Biostatistics at Yale School of Public health. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Iowa, supervised by Drs. Aixin Tan and Jian Huang. My research interests include Bayesian statistics, heterogeneity analysis, hierarchical modeling, and mixture models.
